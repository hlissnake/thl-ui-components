# ToolbarOverflow Component

## Getting Started

The ToolbarOverflow component works by detecting how many of the children are completely showing and moving the rest to a rebass Dropdown. Note this uses the flexbox css methods.

([Live Demo]({{ '/storybook/?selectedKind=ToolbarOverflow&selectedStory=default' | prepend: site.baseurl }}))

```jsx
<OverflowToolbar overflowButton={<Button>More...</Button>}>
    <Button>Test Title 1</Button>
    <Button>Test Title 2</Button>
</OverflowToolbar>
```
