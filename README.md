### Dev Guide

#### Creating New Component

- Create Folder with the name of your new component.
- Add index.jsx, story.jsx and index.md files.
- index.jsx is where your code goes.
- story.jsx is used for prototyping and testing.
- index.md describes the component (we use index.md not README.md so we can share with the live docs).
